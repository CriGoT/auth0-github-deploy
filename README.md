# Auth0 GitHub Deployments

This extension makes it possible to deploy Rules and Database Connection scripts from GitHub to Auth0.

## Running

### Local Development

To run the extension locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run serve:dev
```

After that you need to use something like `ngrok` to expose the extension (Auth0 needs to reach out to the extension for authentication):

```bash
./ngrok http 3000
```

Finally you can login to the extension using your Auth0 dashboard account:

```
https://YOU.ngrok.io/login
```
